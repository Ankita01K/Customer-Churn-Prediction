# Customer-Churn-Prediction

**Customer churn (also known as customer attrition) occurs when a customer stops using a company's products or services.
Customer churn affects profitability, especially in industries where revenues are heavily dependent on subscriptions (e.g. banks, telephone and internet service providers, pay-TV companies, insurance firms, etc.). It is estimated that acquiring a new customer can cost up to five times more than retaining an existing one.**

**Therefore, customer churn analysis is essential as it can help a business:**

**Identify problems in its services (e.g. poor quality product/service, poor customer support, wrong target audience, etc.), and**
**Make correct strategic decisions that would lead to higher customer satisfaction and, consequently, higher customer retention.**

**A range of machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, are widely employed in the prediction of customer churn. These algorithms analyze historical customer data and pertinent characteristics to develop models capable of effectively categorizing customers as either churners or non-churners.**
